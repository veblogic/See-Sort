# See-Sort
See-sort is an attempt to visualize how sorting algorithm function
You can access this application [here](https://see-sort.netlify.app/)

## Quick-start guide
1. Click new array button to create an unsorted array represented by bar chart
2. Use "no of bars" slider to control size of array
3. Use "speed" slider to adjust speed of animation
4. Click any of your favorite sort button to see it in action.

## How to operate?
Use below controls to play with application:

- new array : Create an unsorted random array which is presented as a bar chart 
- no of bars : Use this slider to increase or decrease the size of array to sort
- speed : use to adjust the speed of animation
- Bubble sort : sorts the array using bubble sorting algorithm
- Selection sort : sorts the array using selection sorting algorithm
- Insertion sort : sorts the array using insertion sorting algorithm (yet to implement)
- Quick sort : sorts the array using quick sorting algorithm (yet to implement)
- Merge sort : sorts the array using merge sorting algorithm (yet to implement)
